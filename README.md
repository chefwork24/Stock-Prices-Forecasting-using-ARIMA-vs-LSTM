# ARIMA vs LSTM for Stock Forecasting





## Overview

This project contains the implementation of a ARIMA and LSTM for predicting future prices of GOOGLE stocks.

 

## Results

The comparison between different algorithms is done using MAE(Mean Absolute Error) as a metric.

ARIMA: 35.85500909781393

LSTM:  325.6153406754472

Hence we can see that ARIMA perform  better than LSTM in this scenario



## Data
The GOOGLE stock prices been used for training and testing.
